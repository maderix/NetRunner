# NetRunner
NetRunner is a simple neural network visualizer created in Unity3D. 
At this point it's a proof of concept highlighting the use of Unity's inbuilt Baracuda library to load and run neural network models converted from ONNX.
This example demonstrates a simple two layer dense network trained in Keras on MNIST dataset and converted to ONNX via Keras2ONNX library [ https://pypi.org/project/keras2onnx/ ]
The rendering elements are made using Unity's HDRP pipeline and free assets.
